# **Description** 
Website #1 is the first installment of a series in which I create & publish websites. This website's layout was inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ-Oe4_Ew7g). (Sidenote: Try to ignore this fake company's lore; I just needed something to type. I'll improve my headcanon skills for future websites, I promise ;). )  

Website #1 is the first website I've ever created, so I knew it needed to be formatted simply since I'm not a highly skilled web developer yet. Consequently, I stuck to only implementing HTML5 and CSS3 (JavaScript will definitely be included in future web-dev projects, not just the website series). I didn't want to duplicate the YouTube video since that would prevent me from learning anything, so I primarily focused on differentiating each webpage's main section by relying on the flex display and complimentary colors. Although it's flawed, I'm mostly proud of join.html's main section because I was able to employ the grid and flex displays & make the cards and sign-up form co-exist in the same row without them overlapping.<br></br>
